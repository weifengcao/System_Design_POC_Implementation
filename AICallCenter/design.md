# AICallCenter – Autonomous Conversational Contact Center Design

## 1. Executive Summary
AICallCenter is a production-grade platform that augments and, when appropriate, replaces classical call-center operations with LLM-driven autonomous agents. The system integrates directly with telephony, chat, and ticketing channels, orchestrates real-time conversations, leverages enterprise knowledge bases via retrieval-enhanced reasoning, and ensures human-in-the-loop oversight. Key differentiators include low-latency streaming inference, multi-agent orchestration (conversation, tooling, compliance, supervisor assistant), robust safety/compliance guardrails, and analytics for continuous learning. The architecture targets enterprise deployments where trust, auditability, and integration with CRM/ITSM systems are mandatory. 

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals
### Goals
1. Handle 80%+ of inbound inquiries autonomously via voice and chat while maintaining human-quality CSAT.
2. Provide omnichannel support: PSTN/SIP, web chat, SMS, email, and social messaging.
3. Integrate seamlessly with enterprise stacks (CRM/ERP, ticketing, knowledge bases, payment gateways).
4. Ensure regulatory compliance (PCI, HIPAA, GDPR) with detailed audit trails.
5. Deliver actionable analytics (AHT, sentiment, deflection rate, escalations) and continuous improvement loops.
6. Support modular deployment: self-hosted or managed SaaS, multi-tenant isolation, per-vertical customizations.

### Non-Goals
- Replace the CRM or ticketing systems entirely (we consume and update them).
- Build generalized, open-domain chatbot experiences (focus is on enterprise call-center flows).
- Provide hardware telephones or PBX infrastructure (we integrate with existing providers or cloud telephony).

## 3. Personas & Use Cases
- **Customer**: calls or messages for support/sales; expects fast, accurate resolution.
- **Agent Supervisor**: monitors conversations, intervenes, reviews analytics, configures flows.
- **Knowledge Manager**: curates knowledge base, FAQ, workflow automations.
- **Compliance Officer**: audits transcripts, ensures policies (e.g., PII handling) are followed.
- **DevOps/MLOps Engineer**: manages deployment, observability, model lifecycle.

Key use cases:
1. Inbound voice call: authenticate customer, resolve issue, escalate when needed.
2. Outbound campaign: automated follow-up calls/messages with dynamic scripts.
3. Chat hand-off: AI handles initial chat, transfers to human with context summary.
4. Self-service payments or scheduling via secure tool invocations.
5. Supervisor co-pilot: live recommendations during human agent interactions.

## 4. Requirements
### Functional
- Telephony integration via SIP/PSTN providers (Twilio, Amazon Connect, Genesys, etc).
- Real-time ASR/TTS pipeline with sub-200ms latency per turn.

## 6. Detailed Component Design
### 6.1 Voice & Messaging Edge
- **Telephony Gateway**: SIP trunk termination, WebRTC bridge. Deployed across regions for low latency and redundancy. Handles STIR/SHAKEN, DTMF, call recording.
- **Messaging Gateway**: Websocket microservice for omnichannel chat/SMS/social; normalizes payloads.
- **Call Admission Control**: Limits concurrent sessions per tenant; integrates with billing/quota service.

### 6.2 Audio Pipeline
- **Streaming ASR**: GPU-accelerated models (Whisper variants, Deepgram, or custom), partial transcripts every 100ms. Domain-adapted lexicon.
- **Voice Activity Detection**: for barge-in and silence handling.
- **Neural TTS**: multi-voice library, emotion control; optional low-latency caching for common prompts.
- **Noise Reduction / Echo Cancellation** for high call quality.

### 6.3 Conversation Orchestrator
- Built on LangGraph or custom agent framework supporting streaming LLM calls and tool invocations.
- Maintains per-call state: customer profile, dialog history, active workflow stage.
- **Planner agent** selects next action (answer, ask question, execute tool, escalate).
- **Policy/Compliance agent** vets outputs before TTS; enforces disallowed phrases, PII redactions.
- **Escalation agent** monitors sentiment, deadlocks (multiple failures), compliance breaches -> triggers supervisor alert or call transfer.
- **Context manager** retrieves top-k knowledge snippets (FAQs, SOP, policy docs) via vector DB + knowledge graph (relations: product, region, SLA).
- **Tool executor** interfaces with CRM/ticketing (Salesforce, Zendesk), payment APIs, scheduling systems via secure OAuth credentials.
- Supports multi-modal responses (voice + SMS follow-up with summary).

### 6.4 Supervisor & Human-in-the-Loop
- **Live Dashboard**: shows ongoing conversations, transcripts, sentiment, recommended interventions.
- **Barge-in/Whisper**: supervisor can join call (with recorded approval) or send silent guidance to human agents.
- **Takeover**: immediate transfer to human desk phone/softphone with conversation context summary.
- **Configuration UI**: manage intents, knowledge sources, guardrail policies, toll-free numbers.

### 6.5 Knowledge Fabric
- **Data Sources**: CRM cases, knowledge articles, product manuals, policy docs, historical transcripts.
- **Ingestion pipeline**: connectors + ETL; chunking, metadata tagging (product, language, region).
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone/Weaviate, multi-tenant namespaces, embeddings refreshed on change events.
- **Graph Store**: Neo4j/Neptune capturing relationships (product ↔ policy, intent ↔ resolution recipe); supports path queries for reasoning.
- **Retrieval API**: hybrid search merging vector similarity, keyword filters, graph traversals; returns snippets with citations and confidence scores.

### 6.6 Analytics & QA
- **Streaming analytics**: Kafka topics for transcripts, events; Flink/Spark for metrics (AHT, hold time, deflection, CSAT predictions).
- **Auto QA**: LLM scoring rubric for compliance (greeting, authentication, resolution quality), sentiment analysis, supervisor alerts.
- **Dashboards**: Looker/Mode showing SLA adherence, queue health, savings vs human baseline.
- **Data Lake**: stores raw audio, transcripts, tool logs for offline model training; adheres to retention & redaction policies.

### 6.7 Model Operations
- **Model Catalog**: manages versions of ASR, TTS, LLM, guardrail classifiers; exposes feature flags per tenant.
- **Evaluation Harness**: synthetic and replay scenarios to test new models (latency, accuracy, bias).
- **Safety Filters**: toxicity classifiers, PII detectors, jailbreak guardrails before final response.
- **Prompt/Workflow Versioning**: GitOps for agent prompts, state machine definitions; AB testing with traffic splitting.

### 6.8 Platform & Infrastructure
- Kubernetes clusters across regions with autoscaling for stateless services; GPU pools for inference.
- Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for mTLS, traffic policies.
- API Gateway (Kong/Apigee) for external integrations (supervisor UI, CRM webhooks).
- Observability stack: Prometheus + Grafana, OpenTelemetry tracing, ELK logging with PII redaction.
- Disaster recovery: cross-region replication, cold standby; RPO < 15m, RTO < 1h.

## 7. Data Flow (Inbound Voice Call)
1. Customer dials toll-free number; SIP trunk routes to Voice Edge.
2. Audio pipeline streams audio to ASR; text frames sent to Conversation Orchestrator.
3. Orchestrator updates dialog state, queries knowledge fabric, and decides next action.
4. If tool invocation needed (e.g., order lookup), Tool Executor calls CRM API with scoped credentials.
5. Response passes through Compliance guard; sanitized text fed to TTS for playback.
6. Events (transcript, sentiment, tool usage) streamed to analytics Kafka topics.
7. If escalation triggered, Supervisor console receives alert; takeover executed.
8. At call end: summarizer writes disposition to CRM/ticket; analytics pipeline updates dashboards; data archived for training with retention rules.

## 8. Security & Compliance
- **Identity & Access**: SSO (SAML/OIDC) for supervisors and admins; fine-grained RBAC for agent access to tools.
- **Secrets**: Managed via Vault/KMS; per-tenant encryption keys for data at rest.
- **Data minimization**: PII redaction in transcripts; PCI scope reduction via payment tokenization.
- **Audit trails**: immutable logs (append-only store) for all agent actions, tool calls, and supervisor interventions.
- **Regional isolation**: data residency enforcement (EU, US, APAC) with dedicated clusters.
- **Testing**: regular penetration tests, red-team exercises for prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, and telephony fraud.

## 9. Reliability & Resilience
- Active-active regions with latency-based routing; voice edge uses anycast SIP endpoints.
- Graceful degradation: fallback to human call queue if AI stack degraded.
- Circuit breakers and rate limiting on external tool APIs.
- Chaos engineering program: simulate ASR outage, CRM latency, knowledge index lag.
- Automated rollback of model/prompt updates via feature flags.

## 10. Operational Model & Monetization
- **Deployment options**: SaaS (multi-tenant), VPC deployment (single tenant), on-prem modules for regulated industries.
- **Billing**: per-minute voice usage, per-message chat, premium pricing for advanced analytics and custom models.
- **Marketplace**: optional add-ons (industry-specific knowledge packs, language packs, third-party integrations).

## 11. Roadmap Highlights
1. **MVP (Month 0-3)**: Voice + chat for single tenant, basic knowledge retrieval, manual supervisor controls.
2. **Phase 2 (Month 3-6)**: Multi-tenant support, CRM integrations, analytics dashboards, guardrails.
3. **Phase 3 (Month 6-9)**: Advanced tool actions (payments), auto QA, outbound campaigns, multi-language.
4. **Phase 4 (Month 9-12)**: Self-serve configuration portal, LLM fine-tuning workflows, federated learning across tenants.
5. **Future**: Proactive agent (customer health outreach), multi-modal (screen sharing, document understanding), agent marketplace for vertical-specific recipes.

## 12. Risks & Mitigations
- **LLM Hallucinations**: strict guardrails, retrieval grounding, human escalation threshold; offline evaluation before deployment.
- **Latency Constraints**: streaming inference, model distillation for real-time, GPU autoscaling, caching common flows.
- **Data Drift**: automated retraining pipeline, knowledge freshness monitoring, QA sampling with human review.
- **Regulatory**: early legal review, compliance templates per vertical, optional on-prem deployments.
- **Telephony Quality**: partner with Tier-1 carriers; continuous MOS scoring; fallback to human queue.
- **Customer Trust**: transparent disclosure of AI usage, opt-out options, high-quality handoff to humans.

## 13. Funding Pitch Highlights
- Massive operational savings: reduce cost per contact by 60-70%; 24/7 availability.
- Differentiated IP: hybrid agentic architecture + compliance-first design vs. generic chatbots.
- Deep enterprise integrations: faster adoption in industries with legacy systems (banking, insurance, healthcare).
- Data flywheel: transcripts feed continuous improvement models; analytics upsell opportunities.
- Team expertise: combination of AI/ML, telephony, and enterprise software veterans.

This design document provides the foundation for fundraising conversations and technical implementation planning. It balances immediate feasibility with a path to defensible differentiation in the contact center market.
