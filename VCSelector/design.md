# VCSelector System Design

## 1. Problem Statement
VCSelector helps venture capital (VC) firms discover, evaluate, and monitor startups with high potential. The platform must ingest heterogeneous data (applications, financials, product metrics, market signals), generate investability scores, surface investment theses, and support ongoing health monitoring with alerts and strategy recommendations. It targets multi-fund VC firms that manage thousands of opportunities across geographies and need consistent, data-driven workflows.

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals
- **Goals**
  - Centralize startup data ingestion from structured (CRM, financial statements) and unstructured (pitch decks, news) sources.
  - Generate near-real-time scoring, ranking, and investment theses for startups using machine learning and heuristic rules.
  - Provide configurable investment strategies, portfolio monitoring dashboards, and proactive alerts.
  - Enable collaboration across investment teams with audit trails and decision history.
  - Ensure enterprise-grade security, compliance, and reliability.
- **Non-Goals**
  - Replacing human investment committee decisions (system provides decision support).
  - Running full financial transactions or cap table management.
  - Building a generalized data warehouse for all firm analytics (focus is investment evaluation and monitoring).

## 3. Personas & Core Use Cases
- **Investment Partner**: reviews ranked deal flow, deep dives into startup profiles, approves investments.
- **Associate/Analyst**: manages inbound pipeline, enriches data, runs diligence workflows.
- **Portfolio Operations**: monitors existing portfolio, configures health thresholds, receives alerts.
- **Data Science Team**: builds and deploys ML models, adds new data sources, tunes strategy rules.
Key use cases include pipeline ingestion, startup scoring, thesis generation, collaborative investment memo creation, portfolio health monitoring, strategy revision, and compliance reporting.

## 4. Requirements
- **Functional**
  - Ingest data from SaaS connectors (e.g., Crunchbase, PitchBook), manual uploads, emails, and internal CRMs.
  - Support NLP-based extraction from pitch decks and news articles.
  - Maintain startup profiles with versioned attributes (team, traction, financials, market).
  - Provide scoring models customizable per fund (weightings, constraints, exclusion criteria).
  - Generate investment strategy recommendations (e.g., suggested check size, follow-on cadence).
  - Real-time portfolio health dashboards with KPI ingestion from portfolio systems.
  - Event-driven alerting (threshold breaches, negative sentiment, missed milestones).
  - Workflow features: comments, approvals, task assignments, audit logs.
  - External API/webhooks for surfacing insights into partner CRMs or Slack.
- **Non-Functional**
  - Low-latency scoring (<500 ms P99 per startup lookup) for interactive usage.
  - Support 100k+ active startups, 10k signals/day, 500 concurrent users.
  - SLA: 99.9% availability for core evaluation APIs; 99% for reports.
  - Data freshness: <5 min latency for streaming sources; <24h for batch.
  - Strong RBAC, SOC2-ready audit logging, encryption at rest/in transit.
  - Model explainability (feature contributions) to satisfy regulatory/compliance needs.

## 5. Assumptions & Scale
- Firms manage ~10 funds, each with ~50 thesis configurations.
- Startup attributes average 2 KB each; total profile ~200 KB. For 100k startups, primary store ~20 GB excluding history.
- Daily signals: social/news (~5k), product metrics (~3k), financial updates (~2k). Peak ingestion ~2x.
- Model training weekly with historical data (3 years of signals ~1 TB in object storage).
- Alert fan-out: <50 recipients per event (email, Slack, in-app).

## 6. High-Level Architecture
Components:
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - SaaS connectors (REST) -> ingestion microservices.
   - File ingestion (S3/GCS uploads) with OCR/NLP pipelines.
   - Streaming connectors (Kafka, webhooks) for real-time signals.
2. **Processing & Enrichment**
   - Data validation, schema normalization, entity resolution.
   - Feature extraction pipelines using Spark/Flink; text embeddings via managed model service.
3. **Core Services**
   - **Startup Profile Service (SPS)**: authoritative source with versioned documents stored in a scalable document DB (e.g., MongoDB/DocumentDB).
   - **Feature Store**: low-latency read/write layer for model features (Redis/Feast backed by BigQuery/Snowflake).
   - **Scoring & Theses Engine**: orchestrates ML models (XGBoost/Transformer) with rule engine (e.g., Drools) to combine signals.
   - **Strategy Service**: maps scores to investment recommendations using configurable playbooks.
   - **Monitoring & Alerts Service**: time-series evaluation (TSDB like TimescaleDB) and rule evaluation.
4. **Analytics & ML Platform**
   - Data lake (S3 + Iceberg) for raw/curated layers.
   - Training pipelines (EMR/SageMaker/Databricks) with CI/CD for models.
5. **Experience Layer**
   - GraphQL/REST API Gateway for web app and external integrations.
   - React/Next.js web client, mobile (optional).
6. **Infrastructure**
   - Kubernetes for stateless services, managed databases, Kafka, feature store.
   - Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for observability, policy enforcement.

## 7. Data Flow
1. **Pipeline Intake**: New startup arrives via API/upload. Ingestion service normalizes data, stores raw payload in data lake, publishes `startup.raw` event.
2. **Entity Resolution**: Dedup pipeline matches against existing entities; updates SPS via gRPC. SPS writes new version and emits `startup.updated`.
3. **Feature Computation**: `startup.updated` triggers enrichment jobs to compute features (growth rates, sentiment). Features stored in feature store with timestamps.
4. **Scoring**: Scoring service consumes `startup.updated` or on-demand queries, fetches features, runs ML model, merges rule-based adjustments, persists score and explanations in SPS.
5. **Strategy Recommendation**: Strategy service reads score + firm configs, outputs recommended check size, lead/follow strategy, timeline.
6. **Portfolio Monitoring**: Portfolio metrics stream into TSDB; alert evaluator runs periodic jobs and pushes alerts via notification service.
7. **User Interaction**: Web client calls API Gateway for dashboards, search (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch), collaboration actions. Writes go via APIs to SPS, Workflow service, etc.

## 8. Detailed Component Design

- **Webhook/Streaming**: Send updates to partners; receive real-time signals from third parties.
- **Internal gRPC** between services for low latency and type safety.
- Access controlled via API Gateway with fine-grained scopes and per-fund isolation.

## 11. Scaling & Performance
- Stateless services horizontally autoscale (HPA) based on CPU/QPS.
- Kafka partitions sized for ingestion throughput; Flink jobs scale with task slots.
- Caching layers (Redis) for frequently accessed scores, reducing MongoDB load.
- Read replicas for analytics workloads; eventual consistency acceptable for <5 min delays.
- Batch ETL scheduled with Airflow; ensure idempotent jobs for retries.

## 12. Reliability & Observability

- Circuit breakers and bulkheads via service mesh.
- Comprehensive monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana, distributed tracing (Jaeger), structured logging (ELK).
- Runbook automation for incident response; chaos testing for failure modes (connector outage, scoring service degradation).

## 13. Security & Compliance
- SSO + RBAC + ABAC (resource-level, fund-level access).
- Data encryption (KMS-managed keys), secrets via Vault.
- PII/financial data tokenization; audit logs immutable in QLDB/WORM storage.
- Compliance automation (SOC2, GDPR): data residency controls, consent tracking.
- Model governance: approval workflows for deploying new scoring models, bias monitoring.

## 14. Deployment & Lifecycle
- GitOps (ArgoCD) for Kubernetes manifests; Terraform for infra provisioning.
- CI/CD with canary deployments; feature flags for gradual rollout.
